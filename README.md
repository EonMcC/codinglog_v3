# Coding Log v3

This is the third iteration of my coding log app. It is a browse based app that helps log time spent programming.

V1 and V2 of the app ran in terminal/command prompt and saved data in text files, so V3 was created for the browser and uses PSQL. This has helped me cement my knowledge of Ruby, Sinatra and PSQL.
