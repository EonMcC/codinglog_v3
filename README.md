# Coding Log v3

This is the third iteration of my coding log app. It is a browser app that helps log time spent programming.

V1 and V2 of the app ran in terminal/command prompt and saved data in text files, so V3 was created for the browser and uses PSQL. This has helped me cement my knowledge of Ruby, Sinatra and PSQL.

The code could be DRYer and it was my intention to refactor, however, since finishing the app I have learned JavaScript and therefore, any future changes/refactoring to the app would be added after converting it to JavaScript.
