# Coding Log v3

This is the third iteration of my coding log app. It is a browser app that helps log time spent programming.

V1 and V2 of the app ran in terminal/command prompt and saved data in text files, so V3 was created for the browser and uses PSQL. This has helped me cement my knowledge of Ruby, Sinatra and PSQL.

To run:
In the route directory type 'ruby codinglog.rb'
